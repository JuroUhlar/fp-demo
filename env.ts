 * In this file we manage environment variables using [t3-env](https://env.t3.gg/docs/introduction).
 * This is basically the same as just importing them like `process.env.VARIABLE` but:
 * - It provides a strongly typed `ENV` object so typos will result in TypeScript errors
 * - If a required environment variable is missing, it will throw an error at build time instead of runtime
 * - Plus other useful features like Zod validation and transformations, defaults, server vs client checks....
